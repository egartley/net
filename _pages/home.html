<p>Studying computer science at <a href="https://www1.wne.edu/academics/undergraduate/computer-science.cfm">Western New England University</a>, a private college located in Springfield, Massachusetts. Also interested in technology, space exploration and current events. Currently at home for the summer in New York. The fall 2020 semester begins on August 31st. The china virus has not affected Massachusetts as much as other states, so most classes will be taught in person. See the school's webpage <a rel="noopener" href="https://www1.wne.edu/coronavirus/">here</a> for more information about its reopening plans.</p>
