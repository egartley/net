<p>2D game inspired by Doodle Jump which was popular in the early 2010's. This is an attempt at re-creating a similar game in Java.</p>
<p>Much of the code is copied from <a href="https://github.com/egartley/beyond-origins">egartley/beyond-origins</a> as of commit <a href="https://github.com/egartley/beyond-origins/commit/0034758d248a65fb2d7fec3649ccdc66110eb92d">0034758</a>.</p>
<p>Currently, there are platforms that move down the screen in random positions that the player must stay on and not fall off the screen. The longer the player survives, the higher their score is. After falling, the user can retry by pressing enter.</p>
<p>Source code is available on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/egartley/jumper">https://github.com/egartley/jumper</a></p>
<p>Screenshots of the game are displayed below.</p>
