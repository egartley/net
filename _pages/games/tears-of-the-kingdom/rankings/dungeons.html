<p>These are my rankings for the 5 dungeons (or temples) in <i>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</i>. There are several rankings, each based on a different aspect of the dungeon, such as their music or difficulty. All rankings take into account the "lead-up" section as well. See <a href="/games/tears-of-the-kingdom/dungeons">this page</a> for overall thoughts on the dungeons and how they compare to others in the series and BOTW.</p>

<h2>Overall Ranking</h2>
<p>1. Wind Temple<br>
2. Fire Temple<br>
3. Lightning Temple<br>
4. Water Temple<br>
5. Spirit Temple</p>

<p>The Wind Temple is easily at number one, purely for the music and lead-up to the actual dungeon. Difficulty seemed a decent balance between fun and hard. The design was nice and reminded me of the sand ship dungeon from Skyward Sword. The Colgera fight is easily the one of the best in the game for the music alone. It's easy, but the spectacle is on point.</p>

<p>The Lightning and Fire Temples are essentially tied for second, but the Fire Temple is slightly better because it was a bit harder (and bigger) than the Lightning Temple. In the Fire Temple it's not immediately obvious how to get to some of the gongs, whereas in the Lightning Temple there is only one switch that isn't super easy to reach.</p>

<p>As for the Water and Spirit Temples, they are a distant 4th and 5th. Both were way too short, and the Spirit Temple is hardly a "dungeon," even counting the part in the Construct Factory where you have to get the four body parts for Mineru's construct.</p>
